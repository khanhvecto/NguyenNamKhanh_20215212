2. Working with method overloading
	Compare 2 method: the array parameter method is more effective because i can add more disc to the Cart easily. I prefer the method which its parameter is a list.
3. Passing parameter
	After the call of swap(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD), the title sitll remains because we pass the arguments by value. The change inside not affects the outside.
	After the call of changeTitle(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD.getTitle()), the title changes because we passed arguments by references. The change affect it real value.
	The appropriate swap() method to correctly swap the value:
		public static void swap(DI) {
			
		}
