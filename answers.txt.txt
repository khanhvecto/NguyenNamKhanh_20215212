2. Working with method overloading
	Compare 2 method: the array parameter method is more effective because i can add more disc to the Cart easily. I prefer the method which its parameter is a list.
3. Passing parameter
	- Java is a pass by value programming language.
	- After the call of swap(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD), the title sitll remains because we pass the arguments by value. The change inside not affects the outside.
	- After the call of changeTitle(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD.getTitle()), the title changes because we passed arguments by references. The change affect it real value.
	- The appropriate swap() method to correctly swap the value:
		public static Address swap(DigitalVideoDisc d1, DigitalVideoDisc d2) {
			return new Address(d1, d2);
		}
In this method, we return an Adress object, which contains 2 swapped references. Adress class is definded as below:
		public class Address {
			private DigitalVideoDisc address1;
			private DigitalVideoDisc address2;
	
			public Address(DigitalVideoDisc d1, DigitalVideoDisc d2) {
				address1 = d1;
				address2 = d2;
			}
			public DigitalVideoDisc getAddress1() {
				return address1;
			}
			public DigitalVideoDisc getAddress2() {
				return address2;
			}
		}
So in the main method, after swap, we store the return in a new Adress object, then we pass the value in that to jungleDVD and cinderellaDVD:
		Address newaddress = swap(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD);
		jungleDVD = newaddress.getAddress1();
		cinderellaDVD = newaddress.getAddress2();
